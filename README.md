## Overview

Create Batch Files for PS3 Games is a Windows application that provides a simple user interface to generate batch files for your PS3 game collection. These batch files allow you to quickly launch your games directly via RPCS3, integrate them into emulator frontends, or add them to platforms like Steam. The application automatically detects game folders and extracts game titles from `PARAM.SFO` files for accurate naming.

## Features

-   **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear guidance through each step of the process.
-   **Automatic Game Detection**: Identifies PS3 game folders based on the presence of `PS3_GAME\USRDIR\EBOOT.BIN` and `PARAM.SFO` files.
-   **Accurate Batch File Naming**: Reads `PARAM.SFO` to extract the official game `TITLE` or `TITLE_ID` for naming batch files.
-   **Seamless Game Launching**: Generated batch files can be used to launch games directly, integrated into any emulator frontend, or added as non-Steam games.
-   **Detailed Logging**: Provides real-time log messages to inform you of the progress and any issues during the batch file creation process.

## Requirements

-   Windows 7 or later
-   [.NET 9.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
-   RPCS3 emulator (`rpcs3.exe`)

## Installation

1.  Download the latest release.
